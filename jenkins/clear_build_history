Go to your Jenkins home page -> Manage Jenkins -> Script Console.
Copy and paste this script to your Console Script text area and change the "copy_folder" to the project name that you need to clean the history. Then click the Run button.

  def jobName = "copy_folder"  
	def job = Jenkins.instance.getItem(jobName)  
	job.getBuilds().each { it.delete() }  
	job.nextBuildNumber = 1   
	job.save()
